Wine Quality Prediction

Project Overview



This project leverages the Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. By cleaning the data, engineering detailed features, and visualizing key variables, the project builds a Linear Regression model to estimate wine quality scores accurately.



Dataset



The dataset contains chemical measurements such as acidity, sugar levels, pH, and alcohol content, alongside expert-assigned quality ratings for each wine sample.



Features \& Approach



Data Cleaning: Missing values were handled to ensure dataset completeness.



Feature Engineering: Columns were broken down into detailed features to capture more information.



Visualization: Matplotlib was used to analyze variable relationships and their impact on wine quality.



Modeling: A Linear Regression model was implemented with scikit-learn to predict wine quality from chemical properties.
